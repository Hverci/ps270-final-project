## Project thoughts

I am interested in exploring data related to human rights, social movements, and the role of social media in the modern political atmosphere. I think some ways I could approach these topics is at looking at if social media is an effective method of raising awareness to human rights issues/violations as well as facilitating change through social movements like protests. I am more interested in looking at this on a global level rather than just a national level.
